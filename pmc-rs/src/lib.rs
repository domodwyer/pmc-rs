#![warn(missing_docs)]

//! `pmc-rs` provides a safe abstraction for interacting with Performance
//! Monitor Counters on [`FreeBSD`].
//!
//! PMCs are part of the CPU hardware and are typically used to profile CPU
//! micro-architecture events such as L1/L2/etc cache hit ratio, instructions
//! processed per CPU tick, TLB lookups, branch mispredictions, etc for a
//! particular application or algorithm. Using PMCs an algorithm can be tuned
//! for performance by minimising CPU stalls, optimising CPU cache usage, etc.
//!
//! The events are defined by the CPU manufacturer (here is the [Intel 64 and
//! IA-32 Architectures Developer's Manual: vol.
//! 3B](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-vol-3b-part-2-manual.html)
//! where the events can be found in section `18.2.1.2 "Pre-defined
//! Architectural Performance Events"`, `Table 18-1 "UMask and Event Select
//! Encodings for Pre-Defined Architectural Performance Events"`).
//!
//! `pmc-rs` makes use of [`libpmc`] and the [`hwpmc`] kernel module on
//! [`FreeBSD`].
